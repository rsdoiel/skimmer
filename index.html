<h1 id="skimmer-project">Skimmer Project</h1>
<p>The Skimmer Project is a set of tools for working with feeds. It
currently drives the <a
href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/antenna">Antenna</a> project.</p>
<p>Skimmer originated as a simple terminal based feed reader.</p>
<p><strong>skimmer</strong> is a lightweight feed reader inspired by <a
href="https://newsboat.org">newsboat</a>. skimmer is very minimal and
deliberately lacks features. It has less features than newsboat. I think
skimmer’s best feature is what it doesn’t do. skimmer tries to do two
things well.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Read a list of URLs, fetch the feeds and write the items to an
SQLite 3 database</li>
<li>Display the items from the SQLite 3 database in reverse
chronological order</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it. That is skimmer secret power. It does only two things.
There is no elaborate user interface beyond standard input, standard
output and standard error found on POSIX type operating systems.</p>
<p>If you invoke Skimmer’s “interactive” mode your choices are still
very limited.</p>
<ul>
<li>press enter and go to next item</li>
<li>press “n” and mark the item read</li>
<li>press “s” and mark the item “save” the item</li>
<li>press “q” and quit interactive mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>By storing the item information in an SQLite3 database (like
newsboat’s cache.db file) I can re-purpose the feed content as needed.
An example is my <a href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/antenna">Antenna</a>
experiment. It is a personal news aggregation website. Another might be
to convert the entries to BibTeX and manage them as reference. Lots of
options are possible. The key here is the SQLite3 database file.</p>
<p>included in the Go based part of the project are a few additional
tools that helped in creating Antenna. Longer run I am thinking about
changing horses to Deno compiled TypeScript to take advantage of the
work that Dave Winer has done, see <a
href="https://github.com/scripting"
class="uri">https://github.com/scripting</a>. increasing I see Skimmer
evolving from feed reading and link blogging tool to something more
generalized like serving as a post creation tool allowing for publishing
static content in Markdown through RSS feeds delivering Markdown content
to straight up blogging and micro blogging.</p>
<h2 id="skimmers-url-list">skimmer’s url list</h2>
<p>As mentioned skimmer was very much inspired by newsboat. In fact it
uses and enhanced version of newsboat’s urls list format. That’s because
skimmer isn’t trying to replace newsboat as a reader of all feeds but
instead gives me more options for what I can do with the feeds I’ve
collected.</p>
<p>The newsboat urls file boils down to a list of urls, one per line
with an optional “label” added after the url. That “label” is expressed
as a double quote, tilde, label content followed by a double quote. One
feed per line. That’s really easy to parse. You can add comments using
the hash mark with hash mark and anything to the right ignored when the
urls are read in to skimmer. Skimmer adds a third item on an feed’s
line. After the label you can include the agent string you want to use
when interacting with the feed’s host. That capability was added in
October 2023.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: 2023-10-31, In using the experimental skimmer app in practice
I have found some feed sources still white list access based on user
agent strings. Unfortunately it is highly inconsistently to know which
string is accepted. As a result maintaining a list of feeds is really
challenging unless you can specific a user agent string per feed source
for those that need it. As a result I’ve add an additional column of
content to the newsboat url file format. A user agent can be included
after a feed’s label by adding a space and the user agent string
value.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: 2025-02-14, I’ve been relying on skimmer to browse my RSS
feeds collections for a couple years now. By and large it works. Since I
started Skimmer I’ve noticed how the new crop of social media platforms
have also included RSS support. You can follow people using RSS feeds on
Mastodon, BlueSky, and Threads. While we’re also experiencing an AI
driven bot meltdown on the web my hope is that RSS feed practices will
continue.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: 2025-08-17, Skimmer will can now use a simple YAML file for
configuration. If you set the “app_name” and “version” properties in
that file that’ll be used as the user agent string when harvesting
content from the feed sources.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="skimmers-sqlite-3-database">Skimmer’s SQLite 3 database</h2>
<p>Skimmer uses SQLite 3 databases to hold collections of feeds and
their items. It doesn’t use newsboat’s cache.db but is very much
inspired by it. The name of a Skimmer database ends in “.skim” and pairs
with the name of the urls in a Skimmer url LIST. file. Example if I have
a urls list named “my_news.txt” the <strong>skimmer</strong> program
will use a database file (and create it if it doesn’t exist) called
“my_news.skim”. Each time skimmer reads the urls file it will replace
the content in the skimmer database file except for any notations about
a given item having been read or saved.</p>
<h2 id="skimmer-feed-types">skimmer feed types</h2>
<p>Presently skimmer is focused on reading RSS 2, Atom and jsonfeeds as
that is provided by the Go package skimmer uses (i.e. <a
href="https://github.com/mmcdole/goread">goread</a>). Someday, maybe, I
hope to include support for Gopher or Gemini feeds.</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre><code>skimmer [OPTIONS] URL_LIST_FILENAME
skimmer [OPTIONS] SKIMMER_DB_FILENAME [TIME_RANGE]</code></pre>
<p>skimmer have two ways to invoke it. You can fetch the contents from
list of URLs in newsboat urls file format. You can read the items from
the related skimmer database.</p>
<h2 id="options">OPTIONS</h2>
<dl>
<dt>-help</dt>
<dd>
display a help page
</dd>
<dt>-license</dt>
<dd>
display license
</dd>
<dt>-version</dt>
<dd>
display version number and build hash
</dd>
<dt>-limit N</dt>
<dd>
Limit the display the N most recent items
</dd>
<dt>-prune</dt>
<dd>
The deletes items from the items table for the skimmer file provided. If
a time range is provided then the items in the time range will be
deleted. If a single time is provided everything older than that time is
deleted. A time can be specified in several ways. An alias of “today”
would remove all items older than today. If “now” is specified then all
items older then the current time would be removed. Otherwise time can
be specified as a date in YYYY-MM-DD format or timestamp YYYY-MM-DD
HH:MM:SS format.
</dd>
<dt>-i, -interactive</dt>
<dd>
display an item and prompt for next action. e.g. (n)ext, (s)ave, (t)ag,
(q)uit. If you press enter the next item will be displayed without
marking changing the items state (e.g. marking it read). If you press
“n” the item will be marked as read before displaying the next item. If
you press “s” the item will be tagged as saved and next item will be
displayed. If you press “t” you can tag the items. Tagged items are
treated as save but the next item is not fetched. Pressing “q” will quit
interactive mode without changing the last items state.
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>
<p>Fetch and read my newsboat feeds from <code>.newsboat/urls</code>.
This will create a <code>.newsboat/urls.skim</code> if it doesn’t exist.
Remember invoking skimmer with a URLs file will retrieve feeds and their
contents and invoking skimmer with the skimmer database file will let
you read them.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>skimmer .newsboat/urls
skimmer .newsboat/urls.skim</code></pre>
<p>This will fetch and read the feeds from<code>my-news.urls</code>.
This will create a <code>my-news.skim</code> file. When the skimmer
database is read a simplistic interactive mode is presented.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>skimmer my-news.urls
skimmer -i my-news.skim</code></pre>
<p>The same method is used to update your <code>my-news.skim</code> file
and read it.</p>
<p>Export the current state of the skimmer database channels to a urls
file. Feeds that failed to be retrieved will not be in the database
channels table channels table. This is an easy way to get rid of the
cruft and dead feeds.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>skimmer -urls my-news.skim &gt;my-news.urls</code></pre>
<p>Prune the items in the database older than today.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>skimmer -prune my-news.skim today</code></pre>
<p>Prune the items older than September 30, 2023.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>skimmer -prune my-news.skim \
    &quot;2023-09-30 23:59:59&quot;</code></pre>

<h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>This experiment would not be possible with the authors of newsboat,
