# Random ideas

- Add support for Gopher, Gemini and FTP feeds
- Add support for opening in web browser (environment WEBBROWSER, %WEBBROWSER%)
- Add support for opening item in an editor (environment EDITOR, %EDITOR%)
- actions
	- (n)ext to make an item read, pressing enter should just go to the next item
	- (o)pen item in web browser, use an environment variable for the browser to open
	- if (s)ave and (t)ag should go in a separate table, if you've tagged something you saved it
	- if you have saved something I could use SQLite3 full text search extensions in a virtual table
	- It would be nice to  be able to send an item to the Internet Archive so it is preserved
	- (e)dit item would send the content of the item in a quoted form to a temp file which then is opened in your text editor. This would allow building a response blog or media post to a feed item
- tool idea
	- saved items to Markdown page
	- saved items to personal search engine
	- saved items to a "read it" page complete with a save to pocket button
	- skimmer/skimmerd, a web mode version of skimmer would become sort of a personal pocket like service, the re-presentation could use bluemonday and readability to make the retrieved page more readable. It could also include a "save to pocket" button if only the feed item was displayed
