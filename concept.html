<h1 id="skimmer">skimmer</h1>
<p>I have a problem. I like to read my feeds in newsboat but I can’t
seem to get it working on macOS Sonoma yet or get the send to pocket
working under Windows 11 (native and lsw). There are also times I am
using a device where I don’t want to install newsboat I just want to
look at some current content while I’m waiting on something. This has
lead me to think about skimmer. Something that works with RSS, Atom and
jsonfeeds in the same way I use <code>yarnc timeline | less -R</code>.
My inspiration is Dave Winer’s river of news but minus the outline
modality. It’s a stream because it is smaller and more ephemeral than a
river. This has left me with some questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>How simple is would it be to write skimmer?</li>
<li>How much effort would be required to maintain it?</li>
<li>Can this tool incorporate support for twtxt feeds I follow?</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a Go package called <a
href="https://github.com/mmcdole/gofeed">gofeed</a>. The README
describes it as a “universal” feed reading parser.</p>
<h2 id="design-issues">Design issues</h2>
<p>The reader tools needs to output to standard out in the same manner
as <code>yarnc timeline</code> does. The goal isn’t to be newsboat or
Lynx but to present a stream of items usefully formatted.</p>
<p>Some design questions</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Are feeds fetch by the same tool as the reader output I pipe to
less?</li>
<li>How do I handle articles that are reference in more than one feed?
(I really don’t need to see them more than once)</li>
<li>For a given list of feed URLs do I display in descending timestamp
order or by feed? Do I offer a choice?</li>
<li>Can this tool consolidate my twtxt and RSS feed reading?</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="a-thin-wrapper-around-gofeed">A thin wrapper around gofeed</h1>
<p>I see one immediate design decision. Do I fetch the feeds and process
them on each invocation or do I cache there results? If two feeds point
to the same article I think this could be used to fetch the feed
content, parse it and store a common JSON model in a dataset collection
using a SQL Store. This could be done as a tutorial for using dataset Go
package. “Reading” records would then boil down to a query to retrieve
the latest or use some other filter (e.g. like dsquery). Pandoc should
work to render the content to the script in a pleasant way.</p>
<p>I could take advantage of Go’s concurrency model to allow updating
the feeds in the db table while also reading what was available or I
could provide them as separate capabilities.</p>
<p>Another idea would be to render out to other text centered formats
like Gemini and Gopher. This could be useful to for publishing Gemini
and Gopher content from a static blog site while not simply replicating
the repository. E.g. on sfg.org I could pull the content from
rsdoiel.github.io and re-process it into a proper Gopher site and
similarly to a Gemini implementation.</p>
