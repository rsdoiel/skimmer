<h1 id="denotypescript-port-of-skimmer">Deno+TypeScript Port of
Skimmer</h1>
<p>TypeScript seems a good fit for evolving Skimmer and this is an
exploration of porting the Go codebase to TypeScript to be compiled by
Deno. Just as the Go code relies and external package to do the heavy
lifting I can rely on <a href="https://github.com/scripting">Dave
Winer’s JavaScript modules</a> to do the heavy listing.</p>
<h2 id="help-packages">Help Packages</h2>
<p>The follow packages are NPM based but can be used with Deno via add
using the “npm:” prefix.</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple">reallysimple</a>,
support various common feed formats, RSS, Atom and JSON feed</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage">OPML</a>, Dave’s
OPML package for lists of feeds</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="working-with-deno">Working with deno</h2>
<p>The following is how I added these packages for use in Skimmer</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>deno add npm:reallysimple
deno add npm:opml</code></pre>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>The current Skimmer uses a feed file format derived from Newsboat
feed lists. I will need to port the Go implementation of that to
TypeScript if I wish to continue to support that simple text format.
OPML import and export makes allot of sense as that would be
interoperatable with other software. YAML would also be a useful
configuration format given the readability, easy of typing and support
across programming languages.</p>
<h2 id="human-rendered-views">Human rendered views</h2>
<p>Skimmer’s utilies has the ability to turn the harvested feeds into
various formats like Markdown. There are several approach.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://handlebarsjs.com">Handlebarsjs</a>, the Handlebars
template engine (NPM import)</li>
<li><a href="https://jsr.io/@libs/markdown"><span class="citation"
data-cites="libs/markdown">@libs/markdown</span></a>, markdown to HTML
(jsr import)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="future-ideas-to-explore-after-port">Future ideas to explore
after port</h2>
<p>Today Skimmer is focused on reading and support a public reading site
like <a href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/antenna">Antenna</a>. Tomorrows
Skimmer should be fully read write enabling anyone to have their own
Antenna as a turn key solution. An OPML list can be used to identify
collections and the order they are to be listed on the landing page of
the Antenna. Each collection itself could be an OPML file inguested into
the channels tables of an SQLite3 database (each database represents a
collection). Active collections would be use to produce an Antenna like
website using a simple generic design.</p>
<p>Extending Skimmer to be a feed builder. A blog is a list of POSTs.
POST are a text file which might have metadata beyond the text content
(e.g. title, pubDate, createDate, etc). The Metadata of a POST maps to
the attributes of an RSS 2 item. As sugject there should be a way of
pointing at a Markdown document and directly generate an RSS item in a
feed. The channel of the item could be used to build a local copy of the
a markdown blog in the file system. This would be similar to how
<code>pttk blogit</code> works but tied into the SQLite3 database. Items
could be rendered out to a local file system providing the basis for a
statically hosted blog.</p>
<p>Workflow for publishable feed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a Markdonw document some where on local disk,
<code>edit LOCAL_DOC_NAME</code></li>
<li>Use skimit to ingest the Markdown document, gest it with skimmer,
<code>skimit LOCAL_DOC_NAME TARGET_FEED_NAME</code></li>
<li>Render into a blog structured,
<code>skim2blog TARGET_FEED_NAME [OPTIONS]</code></li>
<li>Render RSS for blog,
<code>skim2rss TARGET_FEED_NAME [OPTIONS]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Why is this important? A small social network can be formed from two
or more end points that both use RSS. The Antenna project shows that a
single person can aggregate their own news and not overburden the remote
website. It’s small ammount of procesing that can be done on an SBC like
a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4.</p>
<p>A means of also browsing content by hash tags and “at” tag would make
it more like a social web engine, similarly leveraging the at tags. OPML
can be used to ready build a person’s Antenna.</p>
<p>NOTE: Blue Sky and Mastodon already support RSS output.</p>
