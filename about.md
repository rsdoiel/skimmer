That’s it. That is skimmer secret power. It does only two things. There
is no elaborate user interface beyond standard input, standard output
and standard error found on POSIX type operating systems. Even if you
invoke it in “interactive” mode your choices are limited, press enter
and go to next item, press “n” and mark the item read, press “s” and
save the item, press “q” and quit interactive mode."
